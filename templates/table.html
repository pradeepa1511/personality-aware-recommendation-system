            <h4>Active-Reflective</h4> 
             <p>• Active learners tend to retain and understand information best by doing something active
              with it—discussing or applying it or explaining it to others. Reflective learners prefer to
              think about it quietly first.
              • “Let’s try it out and see how it works” is an active learner’s phrase; “Let’s think it through
              first” is the reflective learner’s response. </p>
            <h4>Sensing-Intuitive</h4> 
            <p>• Sensing learners tend to like learning facts, intuitive learners often prefer discovering possibilities and relationships. 
            • Sensors often like solving problems by well-established methods and dislike complications and surprises; intuitors like innovation and dislike repetition. Sensors are more likely than intuitors to resent being tested on material that has not been explicitly covered in class. </p>
            <h4>Visual-Verbal</h4>
            <p>Visual learners remember best what they see—pictures, diagrams, flow charts, time lines, films, and demonstrations. Verbal learners get more out of words—written and spoken explanations. Everyone learns more when information is presented both visually and verbally.</p>
            <h4>Sequential-Global</h4>
            <p>• Sequential learners tend to gain understanding in linear steps, with each step following logically from the previous one. Global learners tend to learn in large jumps, absorbing material almost randomly without seeing connections, and then suddenly “getting it.” 
            • Sequential learners tend to follow logical stepwise paths in finding solutions; global learners may be able to solve complex problems quickly or put things together in novel ways once they have grasped the big picture, but they may have difficulty explaining how they did it.</p>

            <h4>According to the model on which the ILS is based, there are four dimensions of learning style, with each dimension having two opposite categories (such as active and reflective). The reported score for a dimension indicates your preference for one category.</h4> 
             <p>• If score for a dimension is 1 or 3, you are fairly well balanced on the two categories of that dimension, with only a mild preference. <br>

            • If score for a dimension is 5 or 7, you have a moderate preference for one category of that dimension. You may learn less easily in an environment that fails to address that preference at least some of the time than you would in a more balanced environment.<br>

            • If score for a dimension is 9 or 11, you have a strong preference for one category of that dimension. You may have difficulty learning in an environment that fails to address that preference at least some of the time.</p>
